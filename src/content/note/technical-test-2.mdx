## Question

```text
Wouldn't it be neat if every year, your birthday would
fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday?
Given a certain date, return a string with the day of
the week and the year it will fall in a weekend, starting
with the year (2016). Do this for 50 years in the future.

INPUT
string    date_of_birth
                ^ with this format: dd-mm

OUTPUT
string    future_dates
                ^ wday-yyyy wday-yyyy...
                (where _wday_ can be any of this three values: Fry, Sat, Sun)
                Every date should be separated by one space.

EXAMPLE
Input
"23-10"

Output
"Sun-2016 Fri-2020 Sat-2021 Sun-2022 Fri-2026 Sat-2027
 Sat-2032 Sun-2033 Fri-2037 Sat-2038 Sun-2039 Fri-2043
 Sun-2044 Fri-2048 Sat-2049 Sun-2050 Fri-2054 Sat-2055
 Sat-2060 Sun-2061 Fri-2065"
```

## Answer

```js
const DAY_NAMES = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"];
const START_YEAR = 2016;
const END_YEAR = 2065;

// From Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16353241/10233315
function leapYear(year) {
    return ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0)) || (year % 400 == 0);
}

function run(birthdayDayMonth) {
    const [day, month] = birthdayDayMonth.split("-");
    let futureDates = "";

    for (let year = START_YEAR; year <= END_YEAR; year++) {
        if (birthdayDayMonth === "29-02" && !leapYear(year)) {
            continue;
        }

        const birthdayDate = new Date(`${year}-${month}-${day}`);
        const birthdayIndex = birthdayDate.getDay();
        
        // 0: Sun, 5: Fri, 6: Sat
        const isDayWeekend = [0, 5, 6].includes(birthdayIndex);

        if (isDayWeekend) {
            const append_space = !!futureDates;
            
            if (append_space) {
                futureDates = futureDates + " ";
            }

            const birthdayDay = DAY_NAMES[birthdayIndex];

            futureDates = futureDates + `${birthdayDay}-${year}`;
        }
    }
    
    return futureDates;
}
```
